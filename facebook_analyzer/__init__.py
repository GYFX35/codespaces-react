# This file makes the 'facebook_analyzer' directory a Python package.
# You can leave it empty or add package-level imports here if needed later.

# For example, you might want to make functions from modules directly available:
# from .phishing_detector import analyze_message_for_phishing
# from .fake_profile_detector import analyze_profile_for_fakeness

# For now, keeping it simple. User will import specific modules.
